# This script runs background bad-sector scans on your block devices.
# Invoke it without arguments, and it will look for all devices named
# /dev/hd? and /dev/sd?, and start a read-only scan for each.
# Alternatively, invoke it with an argument which is the full
# pathname of a device file of one of the above forms, and it will
# start a scan on just that disk.
# The output from a scan of <devname> will be written to a logfile
# named badblocks_<devname>.log in the current directory. Check these
# logfiles for results at the completion of the scans; if they
# contain only timing information, then all is well. But if this
# is preceded by lines containing integer sector numbers, then
# badblocks had trouble reading those sectors.
#
# The scan processes are given the lowest-possible I/O priority to
# minimize impact on regular use of the system at the same time.
#
# External package needed: e2fsprogs, time.
